class FileUploaderMixin:
    def file_uploader(self, label, type=None, accept_multiple_files=False, key=None):
        """Display a file uploader widget.
        By default, uploaded files are limited to 200MB. You can configure
        this using the `server.maxUploadSize` config option.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label : str
            A short label explaining to the user what this file uploader is for.

        type : str or list of str or None
            Array of allowed extensions. ['png', 'jpg']
            The default is None, which means all extensions are allowed.

        accept_multiple_files : bool
            If True, allows the user to upload multiple files at the same time,
            in which case the return value will be a list of files.
            Default: False

        key : str
            An optional string to use as the unique key for the widget.
            If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget
            based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may
            not share the same key.

        Returns
        -------
        None or UploadedFile or list of UploadedFile
            - If accept_multiple_files is False, returns either None or
              an UploadedFile object.
            - If accept_multiple_files is True, returns a list with the
              uploaded files as UploadedFile objects. If no files were
              uploaded, returns an empty list.

            The UploadedFile class is a subclass of BytesIO, and therefore
            it is "file-like". This means you can pass them anywhere where
            a file is expected.

        Examples
        --------
        Insert a file uploader that accepts a single file at a time:

        >>> uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a file")
        >>> if uploaded_file is not None:
        ...     # To read file as bytes:
        ...     bytes_data = uploaded_file.getvalue()
        ...     st.write(bytes_data)
        >>>
        ...     # To convert to a string based IO:
        ...     stringio = StringIO(uploaded_file.getvalue().decode("utf-8"))
        ...     st.write(stringio)
        >>>
        ...     # To read file as string:
        ...     string_data = stringio.read()
        ...     st.write(string_data)
        >>>
        ...     # Can be used wherever a "file-like" object is accepted:
        ...     dataframe = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
        ...     st.write(dataframe)

        Insert a file uploader that accepts multiple files at a time:

        >>> uploaded_files = st.file_uploader("Choose a CSV file", accept_multiple_files=True)
        >>> for uploaded_file in uploaded_files:
        ...     bytes_data = uploaded_file.read()
        ...     st.write("filename:", uploaded_file.name)
        ...     st.write(bytes_data)

            # extensions.
